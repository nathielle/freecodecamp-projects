        <p id="tribute-info">Martin Luther King, Jr., original name Michael King, Jr., (born January 15, 1929, Atlanta,
          Georgia, U.S.—died April 4, 1968, Memphis, Tennessee), Baptist minister and social activist who led the civil
          rights movement in the United States from the mid-1950s until his death by assassination in 1968. His
          leadership was fundamental to that movement’s success in ending the legal segregation of African Americans in
          the South and other parts of the United States. King rose to national prominence as head of the Southern
          Christian Leadership Conference, which promoted nonviolent tactics, such as the massive March on Washington
          (1963), to achieve civil rights. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.</p>

        <h3>1955 - The Montgomery Bus Boycott</h3>



        <p>King had been pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, slightly more than a year
          when the city’s small group of civil rights advocates decided to contest racial segregation on that city’s
          public bus system following the incident on December 1, 1955, in which Rosa Parks, an African American woman,
          had refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger and as a consequence was arrested for violating the
          city’s segregation law. Activists formed the Montgomery Improvement Association to boycott the transit system
          and chose King as their leader.</p>

        <h3>1960 - The Southern Christian Leadership Conference</h3>
        <p>In the years from 1960 to 1965, King’s influence reached its zenith. King quickly caught the attention of the
          producers of that budding medium of social change—television. He understood the power of television to
          nationalize and internationalize the struggle for civil rights, and his well-publicized tactics of active
          nonviolence (sit-ins, protest marches) aroused the devoted allegiance of many African Americans and liberal
          whites in all parts of the country, as well as support from the administrations of Presidents Kennedy and
          Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>

        <h3>1963 - The Letter From The Birmingham Jail</h3>
        <p>Near the end of the Birmingham campaign, in an effort to draw together the multiple forces for peaceful
          change and to dramatize to the world the importance of solving the U.S. racial problem, King joined other
          civil rights leaders in organizing the historic March on Washington.On August 28, 1963, an interracial
          assembly of more than 200,000 gathered peaceably in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial to demand equal justice
          for all citizens under the law. Here the crowds were uplifted by the emotional strength and prophetic quality
          of King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech.</p>
